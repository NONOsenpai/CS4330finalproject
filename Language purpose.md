### Java
## History
* Java was started as a project called "Oak" by James Gosling in June 1991. Gosling's goals were to implement a virtual machine and a language that had a familiar C-like notation but with greater uniformity and simplicity than C/C++. 

* Java emphasis on speed

* The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

### C++
* C++ was designed to provide Simula’s facilities for program organization together with C’s efficiency and flexibility for systems programming. It was intended to deliver that to real projects within half a year of the idea. It succeeded.
* C++ emphasis on speed
* c++ was developed from c
