Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties of the program. For example, it's possible for a Java class to obtain the names of all its members and display them.

The ability to examine and manipulate a Java class from within itself may not sound like very much, but in other programming languages this feature simply doesn't exist. For example, there is no way in a Pascal, C, or C++ program to obtain information about the functions defined within that program.

One tangible use of reflection is in JavaBeans, where software components can be manipulated visually via a builder tool. The tool uses reflection to obtain the properties of Java components (classes) as they are dynamically loaded.

A Simple Example
To see how reflection works, consider this simple example:
```java
import java.lang.reflect.*;
 
   public class DumpMethods {
      public static void main(String args[])
      {
         try {
            Class c = Class.forName(args[0]);
            Method m[] = c.getDeclaredMethods();
            for (int i = 0; i < m.length; i++)
            System.out.println(m[i].toString());
         }
         catch (Throwable e) {
            System.err.println(e);
         }
      }
   }
   ```
For an invocation of:
```java
  java DumpMethods java.util.Stack 
the output is:

  public java.lang.Object java.util.Stack.push(
    java.lang.Object)
   public synchronized 
     java.lang.Object java.util.Stack.pop()
   public synchronized
      java.lang.Object java.util.Stack.peek()
   public boolean java.util.Stack.empty()
   public synchronized 
     int java.util.Stack.search(java.lang.Object)
 ```
That is, the method names of class java.util.Stack are listed, along with their fully qualified parameter and return types.

This program loads the specified class using class.forName, and then calls getDeclaredMethods to retrieve the list of methods defined in the class. java.lang.reflect.Method is a class representing a single class method.


C++

As far as creating C++ preprocessor or specialized compiler requires huge amount of work and still can not solve all the problems, I decide to implement first and last approaches (getting type information from debug information and let programmer to provide this information). So CppReflection product consists of the following parts:
Common core: descriptors for classes, fields, methods which provide all reflection functionality.
Helpers for describing type information by programmer: set of macros, overloaded methods, and supplementary classes which makes it possible for programmer to specify only names of fields and methods and all other information (type, offset, size, profile) is calculated automatically. Using this helpers make task of describing types more convenient and less error prone.
Library which is used to extract information from ELF, COFF and some other executable files formats.
Reflection API is described in this document generated by Doxygen. Code for extracting type information from debug data was taken from GNU objdump utility. The rest of this chapter provide more information about describing types by programmer.
It seems to be better to start with an example:
```C++
#include "reflect.h"
#include "typedecl.h"

class A { 
  public:
    int    i;
    char*  pc;
    double d;
  protected:
    long   larr[10];
    A**    ppa;    
    A*     pa;
  public:
    RTTI_DESCRIBE_STRUCT((RTTI_FIELD(i, RTTI_FLD_PUBLIC),
                          RTTI_PTR(pc, RTTI_FLD_PUBLIC),
                          RTTI_FIELD(d, RTTI_FLD_PUBLIC),
                          RTTI_ARRAY(larr, RTTI_FLD_PROTECTED),
                          RTTI_PTR_TO_PTR(ppa, RTTI_FLD_PROTECTED),
                          RTTI_PTR(pa, RTTI_FLD_PROTECTED)));
};

RTTI_REGISTER_STRUCT(A, 0);
```
