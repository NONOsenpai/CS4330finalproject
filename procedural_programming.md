## C++
* The focus is on the processingâ€”the algorithm needed to perform the desired computation. Languages support this paradigm by  providing facilities for passing arguments to functions and returning values from functions. The literature related to this way of thinking is filled with discussion of ways to pass arguments, ways to distinguish different kinds of arguments, different kinds of functions (such as procedures, routines, and macros), and so on.


## JAVA
* Divide and conquer technique
* Construct a large program from smaller pieces (or modules)
* Can be accomplished using methods
* static methods can be called without the need for an object of the class
* Random number generation
* Constants
