Java
In Java, a variable is a reference to an object. A null value thus indicates an unset reference (i.e. a reference to nothing). You can see variables as containers(*), inside which you can put an object of a given type, when the variable is null , it means your container is empty.
C++
The downside of NULL in C++ is that it is a define for 0. This is a value that can be silently converted to pointer, a bool value, a float/double, or an int.
