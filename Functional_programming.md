##  C++
* To paraphrase Bjarne Stroustrup: "C++ is not a functional programming language. C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports functional style programming and other useful styles of programming.
## Java
Java supports "Functional Style Programming" with Lambdas not "Functional Programming". Functional programming is a wholly different paradigm and traditional OOP based programming languages lack functional features in one way or other.
