##C++
* RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization). RAII is the more general method of managing all resources, whereas Garbage Collection * only applies when dealing with memory.
* Emphasis on libraries, rather than core language features. This makes the language far more expressive and general than many others.
* Obsession with speed, while allowing for high level abstraction at both run-time and compile-time.
